Mr Ong

He is a kind and helpful teacher. He will try to make his lesson fun and engaging by cracking science jokes and having more practicals. Sadly, he left in July to take part in a teacher course. I hope that he will be my science teacher again next year."I would love to tell you a joke, but they argon."
He went to heat sugar in a stainless red leaf pan and the pan got wrecked. He got remorseful and went to buy a new red leaf stainless pan for her next story.
I also love colette because she has brain and beauty all in 1 package!
